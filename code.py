It looks like you're asking for a Python script that uses the Duo SDK to monitor Telephony Credits for users who cannot use the Duo app on smartphones and instead rely on Duo Telephony (phone calls or SMS messages). The script should alert when the Telephony Credits are running low, prompting the purchase of more credits to avoid disruptions. Here's an outline of how you can approach this task:

### Duo Script to Monitor Telephony Credits

#### Requirements:

1. **Duo SDK for Python:**
   - Make sure you have the Duo SDK for Python installed. You can typically install it using a package manager like pip:
     ```bash
     pip install duo_client
     ```

2. **API Keys:**
   - Retrieve the "UTD ISO Telephony Credits Monitor API Keys" from the "Shared-Engineering Team â€“ Students" LastPass folder.

#### Python Script:

```python
import duo_client
import requests

# Function to get Telephony Credits information from Duo API
def get_telephony_credits(api_host, integration_key, secret_key, user_id):
    # Set up Duo API client
    admin_api = duo_client.Admin(
        ikey=integration_key,
        skey=secret_key,
        host=api_host
    )

    # Get user details, including Telephony Credits information
    user_details = admin_api.get_user(user_id)

    # Extract Telephony Credits information from the user details
    telephony_credits = user_details.get('telephony_credits', 0)

    return telephony_credits

# Function to check Telephony Credits and send alert if low
def check_telephony_credits(api_host, integration_key, secret_key, user_id, threshold):
    # Get current Telephony Credits
    telephony_credits = get_telephony_credits(api_host, integration_key, secret_key, user_id)

    # Check if Telephony Credits are below the threshold
    if telephony_credits < threshold:
        send_alert(f"Telephony Credits for user {user_id} are running low. Current credits: {telephony_credits}")

# Function to send alert (you may need to customize this based on your alerting system)
def send_alert(message):
    # Use your preferred method to send an alert (e.g., email, Slack, etc.)
    # For example, you can use a simple HTTP request to a webhook
    webhook_url = "YOUR_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL"
    payload = {"text": message}
    requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)

# Set your Duo API information
api_host = "api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com"
integration_key = "YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY"
secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"

# Set the user ID and the Telephony Credits threshold
user_id_to_monitor = "USER_ID_TO_MONITOR"
telephony_credits_threshold = 10  # Adjust this threshold based on your needs

# Check Telephony Credits and send alert if low
check_telephony_credits(api_host, integration_key, secret_key, user_id_to_monitor, telephony_credits_threshold)
```
